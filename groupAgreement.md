“Var i = team” Group Agreement

(Vanessa, Alex, Rocket, Ian)

        Communication Plan:

1.	How will your group communicate with each other? 
        a.	We will be communicating both in person and over Slack.

2.	What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? 
        a.	We have decided to implement a talking item. Whomever holds the item has the floor and others must refrain from interrupting.

3.	Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?
        a.	The talking item will ensure that everyone feels they have a say in the group.


        Conflict plan: 

1.	What will your group do when it encounters conflict? 
        a.	Recognize that there is a problem and if serious enough, call a group meeting. If tensions arise, we have all agreed to take a break and reconvene afterwards with cooler minds.

2.	What will your process be to resolve it?
        a.	We will talk through the problem until resolved. If tensions arise, we have all agreed to take a break and reconvene afterwards with cooler minds.


        Git process:

1.	What is your Git flow? 
        a.	Every 3 hours we will do a ACP. We all must add our names to our commits to prove that we all worked on different parts of the project.

2.	How many people must review a PR?
        a.	In branches, the navigator in a pair reviews the PR. Pushing to master requires all group members review and approval.
        b.	If someone is working solo, they must have another person review and make the group aware. Same rules apply for master PR’s.

3.	Who merges PRs?
        a.	In a pair, the navigator will merge. Solo, the reviewer will merge. Master, any group members who did not touch the code.
